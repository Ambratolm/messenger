This is just a *very basic* wrapper for [Facebook Messenger Web application](https://www.messenger.com) so it acts like a Windows desktop version.

## :information_source: What's the point ?
I used to run this in the past on an very old computer where I needed to use messenger without opening any modern browser or other heavy application, so I made this. It's easy and very basic but it did the job for me well at the time.

This probably won't work today as it's using the [**WebBrowser**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/winforms/controls/webbrowser-control-overview) control, which is a managed wrapper for the deprecated [**ActiveX**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX) WebBrowser control that duplicates [**Internet Explorer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer) Web browsing functionality or just provides a simple HTML document viewer, which is too old to be able to properly render modern Web pages.<br/>
Therefore, the embeded [**Messenger Website**](https://www.messenger.com) will be incompatible and won't work as expected.<br/>
I should probably replace it with a custom [**Chromium**](https://www.chromium.org) based wrapper control.
